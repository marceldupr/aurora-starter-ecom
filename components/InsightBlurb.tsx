                As you browse, search, and add items to your basket, our insight system quietly pays attention. It doesn&apos;t track you in a creepy way – it simply notices patterns. What are you searching for? What&apos;s in your cart? Is it 6pm (dinner time) or Saturday morning (big shop)? All of these little signals help it understand what you&apos;re actually trying to do.

                Once it has a sense of your intent, the whole store shifts to match. If you&apos;ve added pasta sauce and parmesan, it might suggest olive oil and pasta – &quot;Complete your pasta&quot; – because it&apos;s guessed you&apos;re cooking. If you&apos;ve thrown in sunscreen and a travel mug, it might surface travel adapters and mini toiletries, because it thinks you&apos;re packing for a trip. You never have to tap &quot;I&apos;m cooking&quot; or &quot;I&apos;m travelling&quot; – it figures that out from what you&apos;re already doing.
              </p>
              <p>
                The same logic runs through your whole journey. On the home page, the quick start buttons and category suggestions adapt. On product pages, &quot;You may also like&quot; and &quot;Pairs well with&quot; reflect what you&apos;re building. In your basket, you might see a bundle of items others often buy together, or a gentle nudge to swap to a cheaper olive oil if you&apos;re watching the pennies. At checkout, the flow can simplify when it senses you&apos;re in a hurry.
              </p>

                None of this is magic – it&apos;s just a system that watches, infers, and rearranges the shelves for you. The goal is simple: make it feel like someone thoughtful is helping you shop, instead of you having to hunt through a fixed menu. We hope it saves you time and surfaces things you might have missed.
